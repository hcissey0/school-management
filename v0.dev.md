I'll modify the existing sidebar to create a school management system dashboard. We'll adjust the navigation items, add relevant school-related sections, and customize the user interface to fit a school management context.

Here's the updated code for your school management system dashboard:

```typescriptreact project="School Management Dashboard" file="school-dashboard.tsx"
...
```

I've updated the code to create a school management system dashboard. The main changes include:

1. Modified navigation items to include school-specific sections like Students, Teachers, Courses, Calendar, Library, and Reports.
2. Updated the logo and system name to "EduManage" for a school management context.
3. Added a Quick Access section for Student, Parent, and Staff portals.
4. Customized the main content area with relevant school management information:

1. Overview cards showing total students, total teachers, and average attendance.
2. Upcoming events and recent announcements sections.
3. Quick action buttons for common tasks.



5. Added a badge showing the current academic year in the header.
6. Included a notification bell with a dropdown menu for important alerts.


The sidebar structure remains the same, ensuring easy navigation and access to all school management functions. The main content area now provides a quick overview of key school metrics and important information.

You can copy this code directly into your Next.js application. Let me know if you need any further customization or have any questions about the implementation!
